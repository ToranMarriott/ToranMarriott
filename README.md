Hi, I’m Toran 👋  

I’m transitioning into software engineering after leading product-led engineering teams as a non-technical Engineering Manager. Working closely with software and data engineers sparked a deep curiosity about the technical craft itself - and I’ve been building ever since.

I’m currently preparing for a Software Engineering Apprenticeship in 2026, strengthening my foundations through hands-on projects and computer science study.

### 🚀 Projects

- 🌊 River Levels App (in progress)  
  A web app using Environment Agency APIs to surface real-time river data for paddlers. Focused on working with asynchronous data, handling imperfect datasets, and designing for real users.

- 🛒 Kayak Gear Rental (gear-to-go)  
  Kayaking gear rental cart prototype exploring state management, validation, and totals logic.

- 🔐 Password Generator (password-generator)
  Configurable password generator with clipboard integration and input handling.

- 📏 Unit Converter (unit-converter)  
  Interactive multi-unit converter focused on clean logic and UI feedback.

### 🧠 Currently Learning

- JavaScript (ES6+), DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming  
- Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, accessibility, responsive layouts)  
- Computer science foundations (CS50)

### 💡 Interests

Problem decomposition, debugging, systems thinking, real-world data and building tools that help real people.

Always learning.
